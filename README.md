# build_light
A software build light indicator using Arduino. For background, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_light_indicator

See here for more information: https://youtu.be/M72VJyHf5FY

The circuit is located in the circuit folder, built with KiCAD 5.1.4, but I also included a PDF of it.
The code is written in the Arduino IDE, version 1.8.9 as of this writing, and is located in this directory.
The interface scripts are written for Python 3, but should work in Python 2 as well.


The parts I used are available on eBay:

You will also need some 220 ohm resistors and some wire.
