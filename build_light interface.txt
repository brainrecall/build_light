The build_light Arduino project uses a simple single-character interface. These characters are read
from the Arduino serial port, which is at 115200 baud. Simply open the serial port, and send the
characters described here.

The build_light has a global blink mode. This blink mode defines how build_light will operate
any light that is turned on. The blink mode will be used for all future light activations until
the blink mode is changed. When a light is commanded off, it will remain off until turned on. When
turned on the light will acquire the last commanded blink mode.

Multiple commands can be chained into a single string if desired. They will be processed in the
order they are received.

Light Commands:
A - all lights on
a - all lights off (default at power on)
R - red light on
r - red light off
Y - yellow light on
y - yellow light off
G - green light on
g - green light off

Blink Modes:
f - fast blink mode
m - medium blink mode
s - slow blink mode
n - no blinking (default at power on)

Example, green light constantly on:
anG

Example, blink the red light fast, yellow light slow, send:
afRsY
